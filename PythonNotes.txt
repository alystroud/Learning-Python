Notes from Python Course on Codecademy

No {} brackets and no semi-colons;!
Whitespace is really important - unlike C and Java

A function is defined as below:

def function_name(arguments):
    print arguments

Variables don't need to have types when defined, just starting using the name of it.
Can find the type of a variable using:
  type(variable_name)

If statements are similar to C and Java:

if(condition):
    then do this
elif(condition):
    then do this
else:
    do this

Inbuilt functions:
max()
min()
abs()
len()
variable.lower()
variable.upper()

Importing libraries:

import math
   which means you would use math.sqrt()
from math import *
   which means you would use sqrt()

Arrays/Lists:
list_name.index(item) - returns the index number of that item if exists
list_name.insert(index, item) - inserts at that point
list_name.append(item) - inserts at the end of a list
list_name.sort() - sorts the list

Loops:

for number in list:
    print number
